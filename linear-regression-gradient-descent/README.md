## Linear Regression with Gradient Descent

This is the code for a small dataset on mapping the relationship between the test scores of students and the number of hours they studied. Intuitively, there should be a linear relationship between the two and so I employ linear regression with gradient descent technique to achieve the linear equation.

#### Parameters
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

`b` = *intercept*, average score of a student with no study hours put

`m` = *slope*, the average increase in the test score with each study hour

#### Outcome
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

After running the code `python3 linearreg.py`, I get the following results:

`Starting gradient descent at b = 0, m = 0, error = 5565.10783448
Running...
After 1000 iterations b = 0.0443898081852, m = 1.44277287208, error = 115.841903307`

#### Dependencies
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Works on both Python 2 and 3
